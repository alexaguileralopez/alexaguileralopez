### Hello, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me

I'm a passionate Biomedical Engineer with a love for coding and all things tech. My journey into the world of programming began in University, where I completed several projects that sparked my interest and opened a new horizon. Since then, I've been on an exciting path of continuous learning and exploring new technologies.

#### Interests

- ðŸ’» Software Development: I enjoy creating elegant and efficient software solutions to real-world problems. As a biomedical engineer, I believe in the power of technology to positively impact healthcare and human well-being. From designing user-friendly applications to optimizing algorithms, I take pride in developing software that makes a difference in people's lives.

- ðŸ“Š Data Analysis: I enjoy getting insights from unordered data. Whether it's biomedical research, business intelligence, or machine learning projects, I'm driven by the thrill of unlocking knowledge hidden within vast datasets. From collecting and cleaning data to applying advanced statistical techniques, I take pleasure in the process of revealing meaningful patterns and trends that drive informed decision-making.

- ðŸ¤– AI & Machine Learning: I'm intrigued by the potential of AI to revolutionize industries and enhance our lives. From computer vision applications to natural language processing, I'm fascinated by the limitless possibilities AI offers. As an AI enthusiast, I'm dedicated to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that can solve complex problems and shape a better future.

#### Tech Stack

I'm well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, including:

- **Languages**: Python, MATLAB, C, C++, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy 
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, AWS


#### Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- [Modelling Airbnb's Property Listing Dataset](https://github.com/alexaguileralopez/modelling-airbnbs-property-listing-dataset-): Building a framework to systematically train, tune, and evaluate models on several tasks that are tackled by the Airbnb team.
- [Multinational Retail Data Centralisation](https://github.com/alexaguileralopez/multinational-retail-data-centralisation): Producing a system that stores company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location. In addition, accessing that data to get up-to-date metrics for the business. 
- [Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/alexaguileralopez/computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors): Creating a CV system that allows a user to play rock paper scissors with the computer, while only utilising gestures.
